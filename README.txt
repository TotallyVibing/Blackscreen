Hey you guys Mike aka Speed here, and thanks for downloading
BlackScreen.




Now with BlackScreen being fullscreen, you're probably wondering,
"Hey! How am I suppost to close this program???"
Well it's very easy.

On Windows as well as Linux there's a special hotkey/shortcutkey
that you press to close the active window, and it's...


				Alt+F4



Simply open up a web browser, image editor, folder, etc: and press
that hotkey, and the window will close automatically.

(I found this hotkey out by clicking the notepad icon, which is
in the top left part of the window you're viewing now. Once you
click that icon you'll see the menu I saw, and why I memorized that
hotkey)

NOTE: You'll HAFT to use this hotkey to close BlackScreen.





Now I made BlackScreen in Visual Basic simply to prank one of my
friends, but have nothing bad happen to his computer. So if you'd
like to prank others using this program by all means feel free, but
I'm not responsible if you get the crap beat out of you :)
